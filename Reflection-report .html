      <h2>Activity Reflections</h2>
      <p><strong>Activity 1:</strong> In this activity, I learned the importance of collaboration and planning. It taught me how to contribute effectively in a group setting while working on a shared goal.</p>
      <p><strong>Activity 2:</strong> I explored basic HTML/CSS. This helped me understand how to structure and style a webpage from scratch, improving both my technical and creative skills.</p>
      <p><strong>Activity 3:</strong> We focused on system design. I gained insights into user interface flow and usability, which made me more thoughtful when planning digital projects.</p>
      <p><strong>Activity 4:</strong> This was a hands-on development task where I implemented the front-end of a profile system. It solidified my understanding of responsive layout and real-world application.</p>
