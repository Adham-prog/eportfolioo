  <h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
  <div class="reflection-content">
    <p> Looking back on my journey throughout this course, I can say that it has truly helped me grow both personally and academically. I have gained a deeper understanding of Philippine history, especially the life, ideals, and influence of Dr. José Rizal. Each lesson taught me not only historical facts but also valuable life principles like the importance of education, moral courage, critical thinking, and love for one’s country.</p>

    <p> This course was a turning point in how I view my role as a Filipino and as a student. I now see how history connects to the present and how I can apply the values of Rizal in my own life—especially in leadership, responsibility, and using my knowledge for the betterment of society.</p>

    <p> Moving forward, I am inspired to be more involved, more reflective, and more committed to growth not just in my field of Information Technology but also as a responsible citizen. Rizal’s story motivates me to keep learning and to use what I learn for something greater than myself.</p>
